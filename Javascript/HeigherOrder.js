// âœ… Purpose of Higher-Order Functions
// Code Reusability

// You can write generic functions that accept other functions to customize behavior.

// Example: Sorting, filtering, or transforming data.

// Abstraction

// HOFs allow you to abstract repetitive logic and write cleaner, more readable code.

// Functional Programming

// They promote functional programming principles, making code more predictable and testable.

// Less Code, More Clarity

// Reduces the need for loops and conditions, making code concise.

// Modularity

// Functions are treated as values, enabling better modularity and flexibility.
